                    <p class='articles-texto'>What is the original manufacturer’s suggested retail price? Is this in concert with other retailers? Is this a real “discount” or is it an artificially inflated price advertising a huge percentage discount? (For example, a retailer claims that a $1000 mattress is on sale for 50% off at $500 dollars. But the reality is that the mattress originally may have a price tag of $400 or $500 or $600 dollars. You may actually be paying more, paying the full retail price, or only getting a 10% discount). What is the actually bottom line price?</p>

                    <p class='articles-texto'>Retailers may have <i>“exclusives”</i> which simply means that they sell the same exact item under a different name exclusive for their establishment. It is the same concept as the pharmaceutical industry. There is the brand name with the high price tag, or the generic composition, which is a fraction of the cost. Can <i>“exclusives”</i> be the same mattress by a different name?</p>

                        <p class='articles-texto'>Is it a brick-and-mortar match or an on-line match as well? Some retailers will only honor a physical store and not an on-line only company. The reason for this may be that an on-line operation may be providing older and not current models. It may be a floor sample or “slightly used” mattress. It may be another model.</p>

                        <p class='articles-texto'>Will I get a better price if I open an account with the retailer? Can I finance my purchase, and if so, what is the interest rate? Many retailers offer an additional discount if you open an account or elect to open a short term line-of-credit with their company or affiliated bank. Make sure to find out what the terms are, what (if any) the finance charges are, if there is an interest rate, how long the term is, and if it based on price.</p>

Companies that offer you an extended period of time may be hoping that you have gotten use to your new mattress and that you will not bother to exchange after this time period. If you deem that your mattress selection was not right, how long do you have to report it and how long do I have to choose another. Is there a charge to return or exchange a mattress?</p>
