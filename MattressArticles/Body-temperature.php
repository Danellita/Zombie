                <p class='articles-texto'>Most experts agree that core body temperature has a lot to do with how well you sleep. Your circadian rhythm (internal body clock) regulates many functions of the body including heart rate, blood pressure, hormone release, and body temperature; all which act together to help you stay awake during the day, and sleep at night.</p>
                <p class='articles-texto'>Body temperature starts to fall as bedtime approaches, paving the way for a good night's sleep. Your body also tends to lose heat, which helps you fall and stay asleep. ... Your temperature starts to rise toward morning, preparing your body for wakefulness.</p>
                <p class='articles-texto'>If you’re prone to waking up sweat-drenched (or shivering) in the middle of the night, then you know how important it is to find your temperature sweet spot for sleep.</p>
                <p class='articles-texto'>But that midnight chill isn’t necessarily a reason to pile on the blankets. Falling temperatures cue the onset of sleep, and may even help you sleep more soundly. In fact, wearing special clothing that lowers skin temperature by one degree Celsius can reduce middle-of-the-night arousals and early morning waking.</p>
                <p class='articles-texto'>New mattress technology offers us options in helping to regulate our body temperature, with the goal of keeping the body consistent throughout the night. A cooling mattress cover can keep you at the desired body temperature. It will coax you to sleep by cooling you down and keeping you cool, so as to enter deep and REM sleep, and keep you asleep longer.</p>
