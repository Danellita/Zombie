        <p>Similar mattresses have different names and different prices at different retailers. So, the consumer cannot shop prices or features.</p>
        <p>Each offers a 'low price guarantee', because you cannot shop their product anywhere else.</p>

        <p>Most websites give consumers so-called facts, which are skewed to lead you to a particular mattress, which that site is promoting. </p>
